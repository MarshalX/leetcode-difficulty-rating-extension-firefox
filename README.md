## Introduction

Replace Leetcode problem's difficulty with a more precise contest rating sourced from [here](https://github.com/zerotrac/leetcode_problem_rating).

The green/yellow/red text color is preserved, so you can still tell the official difficulty.

Problems in 1st-62nd weekly contests and problems that did not come from contests donâ€™t have rating data and `N/A` is shown by default. You can change the setting in the extension popup.
