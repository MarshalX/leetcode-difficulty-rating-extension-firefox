# leetcode-difficulty-rating-extension

Replace Leetcode problem's difficulty with a more precise contest rating.

The green/yellow/red text color is preserved, so you still can tell the official difficultly.

By default, if no rating is avaliable for the problem, `N/A` will be shown. You can change the setting in extension popup.
